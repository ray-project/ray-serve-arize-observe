Welcome to the Multilingual Chat with Ray Serve repo!

## Tutorial content

In this tutorial, we will explore how to author real-time inference pipelines in Python with Ray Serve and the deployment graph API. We will also discuss scaling and resources allocation problems and show how Ray enables you to simplify and control your deployments. This workshop is especially suited for ML practitioners and ML engineers who look for modern tools for scalable ML.

We will build multilingual chat. System will consist of deep learning models and business logic implemented with Ray Serve and the deployment graph API.
